Bun is an incredibly fast JavaScript runtime, bundler, transpiler and package manager. Bun is a drop-in replacement for JavaScript and TypeScript applications and supports both Node.js and Web standard APIs. It has three main goals:

* Be fast.
* Be performant.
* Be a complete, easy-to-use tool.

Bun is written in Zig, a low-level programming language with manual memory management. Bun uses the JavaScriptCore engine, which tends to start and perform faster than other engines like V8.
